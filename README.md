# NASA Mission Control Project

Welcome to the NASA Mission Control Project! This project is designed to simulate a mission control center for a space mission. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js, and it provides a web interface to monitor and control the mission.

<!-- ## Getting Started

To get started with the NASA Mission Control Project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download them from the official Node.js website https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/nasa-mission-control.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nasa-mission-control`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

After following these steps, you should see a message saying "NASA Mission Control Server is listening on port 3000" in your terminal. You can then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the web interface. -->
